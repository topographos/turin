## Background

![](figures/dispersal.png){fig-align="center"}

## Background

explanation?

-   shift from network to a territorial empire (Liverani, 1988)
-   administrative restructuring and institutional colonisation (Wilkinson, 2000; T J Wilkinson et al., 2005)
-   creation of a landscape of power (Morandi Bonacossi, 1996)
-   *agricultural colonisation* (Parker, 2001)
-   change in land ownership (Casana, 2007)
-   *universalism* and population dynamics (Altaweel and Squitieri, 2018)
-  part of imperial repertoires (Düring, 2020)

## Objective

 

Overall,my research goal is to investigate and quantify the *"landscape of dispersal"* across the Northern Fertile Crescent.

I argue that timing, sequence and magnitude of the change is pertinent to correlate the transformation in landscape with empires.

 

Today, I will:

-   present Exploratory Data Analysis of the settlement **pattern** deploying quantitative metrics of centralization.

-   apply Ideal Free Distribution model to understand the **process** behind the settlement pattern.

## Methods: Settlement Ecology

**Human Behavioral Ecology -- Ideal Distribution Models**

The fundamental premise of the model is that individuals seek to maximize suitability such as subsistence yields.

**variants**:

• Ideal Free Distribution (IFD)

• Ideal Free Distribution with Allee effect (IFDA)

• Ideal Despotic Distribution (IDD)

 

**Question:** Do the settlement patterns show properties predicted by the IFD model?

## Methods: IFD

![](figures/method_ifd_free.png){fig-align="center"}

IFD makes assumption of unconstrained movement into habitats of highest suitability that will decline with rising population density.

## Methods: IFDA

![](figures/method_ifd_allee.png){fig-align="center"}

IFDA incentivize cooperation and investments in landscape to increase habitats suitability but in time population pressure is leading to degradation and habitat depletion .

## Methods: IDD

![](figures/method_ifd_despotic.png){fig-align="center"}

The access to habitats of individuals is controlled by other settlers. **IDD negative** -- despots defended access to high ranked habitats forcing settlers to occupy habitats with lower rank. **IDD positive** - despots allow to occupy their high ranked habitats in return for share in harvest.

## Suitability Index

![\*Menze and Ur (2012) showed correlation between settlements volume / density and river size in Upper Khabur Basin.Data: hydrograph90m](figures/method_suitability.png){fig-align="center"}

## Model Predictions

**IFD and IDD**

-   The first habitats settled will be the most suitable.

-   The most suitable habitats will be occupied longest.

-   The average suitability of a settlement pattern should decrease as sites increase in number.

**IDD**

-   The population density in IDD at the higher ranked habitats is lower than in the IFD (IDD vs IFD dynamics)

## Results

1.  The first habitats settled will be the most suitable.

## Results

2.  The most suitable habitats will be occupied longest.

## Results

3.  The average suitability of a settlement pattern should decrease as sites increase in number.

## Results

4.  The population density in IDD at the higher ranked habitats is lower than in the IFD (IDD vs IFD dynamics)

![\* not fully tested, requires further work](figures/ifd_vs_idd.png){fig-align="center"}

## Conclusions - same old

-   settlements dispersion coincided with Middle Assyrian (1400BC) and Neo-Assyrian (900BC) expansions

-   areas  (NJS, THS) in proximity to Assyrian imperial core experienced increase at higher rate comparing to more modest growth in western Khabur (TBS) and the eastern Navkūr plain (UZGAR)

-   LCP area was dominated by site of Charchemish until population disperse in Hellenistic period (300BC)

## Conclusions - same new

-   results show a general conformity with IFD models

-   settlement strategies sought to maximize agricultural input (as far as access to water is concerned)

-   larger increase in settlement density accompanied by faster drop in suitability around 900 BC shows IDD model properties whereas more sustainable growth may indicate IFD model distribution.

## Discussion / Further work

-   to integrate more archaeological surveys

-   to evaluate centralization metrics

-   model Allee effect by integrating irrigation systems

-   expand on ecological and social variables

-   operationalize distinction between various IDM variants
